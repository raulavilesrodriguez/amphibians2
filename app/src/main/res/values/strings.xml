    <string name="type_test">Toad</string>
    <string name="description_test">This toad spends most of its life underground due to the arid
        desert conditions in which it lives. Spadefoot toads earn the name because of their hind
        legs which are wedged to aid in digging. They are typically grey, green, or brown with
        dark spots.
